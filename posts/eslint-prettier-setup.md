## Setting Up ESLint And Prettier 🎨

![eslint and prettier](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmiro.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1328%2F1*fA65R1umkZBVJjyBTTy6Xw.png&f=1&nofb=1)

### Objective

Setting up linters and code formatters is really important to group projects.
When people are doing things like using different kinds of quotes, or people are
following different semicolon rules, code can become a confusing mess real quick.
Adding things like code formatters and linters can be really beneficial to building
a uniform and readable code base.
This guide aims to help you easily set these things up in your groups project.

### Install ESLint and Prettier VS Code Extensions

Make sure every team member has
[prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
and [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
VS Code extension's installed.

> It's recommended to turn format on save on. Click on prettier link above and
> search for "Format On Save" for instructions on setting that up in vs code.
> Also, check out section "Linter Integration". 🔥

### Configure ESLint and Prettier

Now we need to add dependencies to our project with some rc files! Woo hoo! 👏

In the root of your project's directory run;
`yarn add eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`
or `npm i eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`.

> For react apps, add `eslint-plugin-react` to dependencies as well!
> Then we can add a file named `.eslintrc.js` with the following content for a
> react app.

#### Example React Config

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    commonjs: true,
    browser: true,
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended",
  ],
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaFeatures: {
      jsx: true,
    },
    ecmaVersion: 2018,
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: ["react", "prettier"],
  rules: {},
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ["**/*.test.js"],
      env: {
        jest: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Example Node Config

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    node: true,
    commonjs: true,
    es6: true,
  },
  extends: ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:prettier/recommended"],
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaFeatures: {
    ecmaVersion: 2018,
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: ["prettier"],
  rules: {},
  overrides: [
    {
      files: ["**/*.test.js"],
      env: {
        jest: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

By adding `.prettierrc.js` to our root with the following content
for both React and Node projects, then the whole team will have shared formatter
rules.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  trailingComma: "es5",
  tabWidth: 2,
  semi: true,
  singleQuote: true,
};
```

Then we can add some scripts to our `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint --fix .",
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.+(js|jsx|json|yml|yaml|css|md)\""
  }
}
```

### Conclusion

Setting up ESLint and Prettier in your projects can go a long way in helping you
write better, more readable code. Even more so when your working in a team
environment.

You may have noticed that the "rules" key's where empty in the .eslintrc examples.
ESLint does a lot by default but if you want more in-depth, fine grain control
over the coding style for your project visit their [docs on rules here!](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/)

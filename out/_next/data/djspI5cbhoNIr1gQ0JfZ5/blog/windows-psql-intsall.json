Once the installer is done downloading, run that bad boy.\n\n![Download PostgreSQL](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lyj7u5viavbz1buj92sj.PNG)\n\nOnce you run the installer you downloaded, you should see a screen that looks like this:\n\n![PostgreSQL installer](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hhbi2qbd472xhq27oo14.PNG)\n\nClick `Next >`. Then choose your installation directory:\n\n![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/opydur2eo1fn24zb4mr2.PNG)\n\nSelect components. I would leave all these checked and click `Next >`.\n\n![PostgreSQL components](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/rrarjp52huvkczqv22yw.PNG)\n\nSelect the data directory. I left its default value.\n\n![PostgreSQL data directory](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/muhwhi6p93ovcgkgfrfa.PNG)\n\nSet up a password for your PostgreSQL user. Do something that's really easy to remember. If you're not worried about somebody hacking and finding sensitive data in your local PostgreSQL data, you would probably be fine setting it to `password`.\n\n![PostgreSQL password](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/x1ciy10djmzfjd7f3sk2.PNG)\n\nSet up PostgreSQL port. Default is 5432, I recommend leaving it like that.\n\n![PostgreSQL port](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dqq0lhywc8b7e6s593z1.PNG)\n\nChoose your locale. I speak English and I'm from the United States, so I choose `English, United States`.\n\n![PostgreSQL locale](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4tvx7jrt1m0z9ardi7u9.PNG)\n\nOnce we get to the pre-installation, click `Next >`.\n\n![PostgreSQL pre-installation](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4qkyn1i5376nq925z7sn.PNG)\n\nThen click `Next >` again and it install will start!\n\n![Install PostgreSQL](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/di7598ozmz1al9icqsoz.PNG)\n\nNow, in your Windows search bar, type: `Edit the system environment variables`. Click on that and you should see this:\n\n![Windows env vars](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mayp5zm5rvba6pzq00fe.PNG)\n\nThen click on the `Environment Variables` button.\n\n![User env vars](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3vjxmcxyzcfwrex5f60q.PNG)\n\nClick on PATH under user variables and then `Edit...` and then add the path to your PostgreSQL's bin folder to the list of locations in your PATH variable.\n\n![PostgreSQL path](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/oignl8pyjpfnnfoh2e6w.PNG)\n\nClick `OK` then `OK` and `OK` again. Once you've closed out of everything you should open up your terminal and type `psql -U postgres` and it will ask you for PostgreSQL's password. Whatever you set it as during the installer will be what you want to type in, and tada! ðŸŽ‰ You can now use PostgreSQL in the terminal now!\n","data":{"title":"Postgres Setup On Windows","image":"https://i.imgur.com/hTdGW2y.png","description":"In this tutorial we will go over installing PostgreSQL on a Windows 10 machine, install pgAdmin4, as well as set up our path variable for postgres so we can access postgres from our terminal."}},"__N_SSG":true}

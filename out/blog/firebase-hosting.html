By connecting your project to Google&#x27;s Firebase you will have access to their cloud storage, cloud firestore and real-time database, authentication, analytics and much more.
Firebase handles all of our hosting and back end needs in one place that is incredibly easy to use, once you got the know-how.</p><p>In this tutorial, we are going to cover only how to deploy a react app to Firebase. I am going to use the create-react-app we&#x27;ve hosted in the next tutorial on how to set up user authentication with Firebase using hooks and redux so stay tuned for that!</p><h3>Let&#x27;s get started</h3><h4>Step 1</h4><p>Let&#x27;s start by creating a new project on GitHub!</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 1</em></strong>
<img alt="Create a new GitHub repo" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cjo298ycg3fqan173v1m.png"/></p><p>Now let&#x27;s name our project, and we can give it a description and an MIT license if we want to. I did not give it a README or a .gitignore because CRA will give us both of those things.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 2</em></strong>
<img alt="Set up project" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/42fvecwtvn7fc9ayik4s.png"/></p><p>Now that our project has been created on GitHub lets copy that HTTPS or SSH (whichever you use) link and clone it to our computer!</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 3</em></strong>
<img alt="Copy repo link" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ehn8n8cpas5934i7jgd2.png"/></p><p>Once we&#x27;ve cloned our project in the directory we want to use, before we cd inside of that directory we can run <code>create-react-app &lt;name-of-your-project&gt;</code> and it will run CRA inside of the repo we just cloned as long as we name it the same as the cloned repo when we run CRA. Now we have our CRA in the root and can cd inside our project directory and <code>yarn start</code>. <em>Note: If you want to use npm, then delete your yarn.lock file so that you don&#x27;t have a yarn.lock AND a package-lock.json file in the same project. This can lead to issues, however, I personally recommend sticking with yarn.</em></p><p><strong><em>Fig. 4</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Clone and run CRA in your cloned repo" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hwis1jhwu7te8khpbm4j.png"/></p><h4>Set 2</h4><p>Now that we have our project set up in GitHub and cloned to our computer lets set up our project in Firebase! Go to firebase.google.com and create a project.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 5</em></strong>
<img alt="Create a project" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/83i41i0quig4er2bau1e.png"/></p><p>Name your project.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 6</em></strong>
<img alt="Name your project" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ho19lyz68y2qptq621yc.png"/></p><p>Google Analytics is enabled by default, we might want to use it later so let&#x27;s leave it that way.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 7</em></strong>
<img alt="Alt Text" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/f1wur6354icprv91uey1.png"/></p><p>Let&#x27;s just select the &quot;Default Account for Firebase&quot; option for now.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 8</em></strong>
<img alt="Select &quot;Default Account for Firebase&quot;" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xycxxp3i5kbhu9dewt8v.png"/></p><p>Congratulations, you now have a Firebase project!</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 9</em></strong>
<img alt="Firebase project" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/tuuo8av1fnzdi2skzds1.png"/></p><h4>Step 3</h4><p>Now that we have our GitHub repo created and cloned to our computer and we&#x27;ve created our project on firebase it&#x27;s time to connect the two together and get our React app out there for the world to see! Let&#x27;s take a dive into our terminal and set things up! In our project&#x27;s root directory lets run <code>firebase login</code> and select yes when it asks up to allow Firebase to collect information.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 10</em></strong>
<img alt="Firebase login" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/at1iyj3m6c5afybkor56.png"/></p><p>After selecting &#x27;yes&#x27; it will open our browser and ask which google account we want to use to sign in. Select the account we used to create our Firebase project.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 11</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Choose Google account you want to log in as" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/hzjd0eu1v26ab6ledw56.png"/></p><p>Now let&#x27;s allow Firebase CLI to use our Google account:</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 12</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Allow Firebase CLI access to chosen Google account" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/gsqduvbmsqwy9y7ymmeo.png"/></p><p>And, wallah!!!

This will run our build folder on a local server. The build folder will only update every time you run <code>yarn build</code> <strong>or</strong> <code>npm run-scripts build</code>. You could go into your build folder and manually edit it, however, I would not recommend doing that.</p><p>When we deploy our app on firebase we want to deploy what&#x27;s in our build folder, so it&#x27;s a good idea to spin it up on a local server and make sure everything looks and works right. Once you have verified that the build was successful you could <code>ctrl/cmd + c</code> to stop the server inside our server and we can move on to the next step...</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 15</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Running build folder on localhost:5000" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/wc3kyx6ju4bpgeff780p.png"/></p><h4>Step 5</h4><p>It&#x27;s time to initialize firebase in our app! The command is <code>firebase init</code>. It will ask you which Firebase CLI features you want to set up. Use the down arrow key to highlight Hosting and then press the space-bar to select. Once you&#x27;ve selected Hosting, hit enter/return to continue.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 16</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Select &#x27;Hosting&#x27; option" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/dduzpo2eg9qq3jxaayhy.png"/></p><p>Now select <code>Use an existing project</code>.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 17</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Select &#x27;Use an existing project&#x27;" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/o1ns97wil6vzn9edhzcs.png"/></p><p>Now let&#x27;s select that project we created on Firebase earlier, we only have one project created, and we see that&#x27;s the only option here.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 18</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Select our Firebase project" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0o0s370h4bkdbfyi6j22.png"/></p><p>It&#x27;s now asking us what we want to the user as our public directory.

If you do accidentally say yes here then all you have to do is run <code>yarn build</code> <strong>or</strong> <code>npm run-scripts build</code> again to overwrite Firebase&#x27;s index.html and get our site back up and view-able again.</p><p><strong><em>Fig. 21</em></strong></p><p><img alt="Do not overwrite build/index.html" src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/o3lwdhr78ogntq1eama5.png"/></p><p>And wallah!!!

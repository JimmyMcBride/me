## About Me

I have a huge passion for developing full stack applications.

I'm the proud owner of my own open source style library, Bushido-strap.

Big Linux nut. You can typically catch me writing bash scripts and working on my dotfiles.

Experimenting with code is my jam, I'm all about playing around with new ways to build apps.

Love to blog about all things related to React, bash, Linux, and general experimentation with code.

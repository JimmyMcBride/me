## Lambda Bug Tracker

### About This Project

I built this project with a team of colleagues from Lambda for their 2019 Winter Hackathon. It's a bug tracker app similar to Trello. After you log in, you can create projects and get assigned a board with a todo, in progress, and done column. You can create cards with different priority levels and other specifications. If you would like to see what our app could do, [check out the YouTube video.](https://youtu.be/0bfnV-ZGwKc)

### My Contribution

I set the authentication, private route flow, and worked on the back end. Also, the team also a style library I had built.

### Projects Impact

The impact of this project had, was not on the product itself, but on the learning experience of building something with a team in only 30 hours. Having the team use my style library also highlighted some growth areas for my library and helped improved it a lot.

### What I Learned

Persistence and teamwork will help you achieve goals you could not do alone. Hackathons are marathons that test your mental stamina, and I look forward to participating in more hackathons in the future.
